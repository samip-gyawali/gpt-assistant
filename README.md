# JARVIS
Inspired by Marvel's JARVIS, this project uses OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model to function as a chatting AI assistant.

# Usage:
- User may ask questions in the input
- The gpt-3.5-turbo model generates response
- The response is then converted to voice by gTTs library
- It is played by the playsound library

# User Guide:
- When the terminal says `You may now speak`, the user has 5 seconds to assign a prompt for the chatbot to respond to
- The system responds with a reply and stores this chat for future use.
- The AI remembers the previous chat

# Requirements: 
- a valid openAI api key
- python3 installed
- pip installed
# Setup
1. Create a `.env` file, write `apikey='<YOUR OPENAI API_KEY>'` inside it, and save it in the same directory as `gpt.py`
2. run `pip install openai`, `pip install dotenv`, `pip install gtts`, `pip install playsound` and `pip3 install SpeechRecognition pydub`.

3. Run the `gpt.py` file

# Code Documentation
Libraries:
- openai
- dotenv
- gtts
- playsound
- speech_recognition

# The `askGpt()` module:
- Takes `user_prompt` as a parameter
- Provides the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model with a few examples to train it as JARVIS
- Returns the response generated by the AI chatbot

# The `tts.speak()` module
- Takes in text to speak as a parameter
- Uses gtts library to create an audio file, plays it and deletes the file

# The `stt.listen()` module
- gives the user 5 seconds to speak, and turns the voice into text
- the text is used as the prompt for the user

# Working:
- Program asks user for a prompt
- Prompt is taken by voice through the `stt.listen()` module
- Gets response from the AI through the `askGpt()` module
- Speaks the response through the `tts.speak()` module
