# JARVIS
Built on the openAI gpt-3.5-turbo model.

Usage:
- User may ask questions in the input
- The gpt-3.5-turbo model generates response
- The response is then converted to voice by gTTs library
- It is played by the playsound library

User Guide:
- When the terminal says `You may now speak`, the user has 5 seconds to assign a prompt for the chatbot to respond to
- The system responds with a reply and stores this chat for future use.
- The AI remembers the previous chat

- Provides the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model with a few examples to train it as JARVIS
- Returns the response generated by the AI chatbot

# The `tts.speak()` module
- Takes in text to speak as a parameter
- Uses gtts library to create an audio file, plays it and deletes the file
